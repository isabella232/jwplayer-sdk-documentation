## About the SDK

The JW Player SDK for iOS is built upon the native iOS player framework, AVFoundation.  Apps built with this SDK integrate with video hosting, streaming, and analytics services. These services allow you to incorporate a video experience, monetize your app, and discover ways to increase viewer engagement. You can also use this SDK with video content that is hosted with non-JW Player services.

### Key features

* HLS, SmoothStreaming, and MP4 playback
* Rich configuration options including playlists, content title and poster image
* Fullscreen video playback
* Full-featured API to monitor player, playlist, playback, and content state
* API to monitor and set video and audio qualities.
* VAST, VMAP, and VPAID advertising
* FreeWheel and Google IMA advertising support
* API design that enables native control creation and can be applied to Android and web player implementations
