# Non-linear ads

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/SDK-iOS%20v3-0AAC29.svg?logo=apple">

Non-linear ads are now supported by our vast plugin. You can either pass in a non-linear ad tag or pass in a VMAP file containing an ad overlay; in the case of a non-linear ad tag, you must set the `JWAdBreak`'s `type` property to `JWAdTypeNonlinear`.
Please note that Google IMA does not support non-linear ads currently. 

```objc
JWAdBreak *nonlinearAdBreak = [JWAdBreak adBreakWithTag:@"nonlinear/ad.xml" offset:@"5"];
nonlinearAdBreak.type = JWAdTypeNonlinear;
```
```swift
var nonlinearAdBreak  = JWAdBreak(tag: "nonlinear/ad.xml", offset: "5")
nonlinearAdBreak.type = .nonlinear
```
