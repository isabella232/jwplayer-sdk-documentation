# Ad Waterfalling

To create an ad waterfall, an array of ad tags is passed to a `JWAdBreak` object:

```objc
NSArray *tags = @[@"/firstVast.xml", @"/secondVast.xml"];
JWAdBreak *adBreak = [JWAdBreak adBreakWithTags:tags offset:@"10%"];
```
```swift
var tags    = ["/firstVast.xml", "/secondVast.xml"]
var adBreak = JWAdBreak(tags: tags, offset: "10%")
```

If the first tag in the tags array fails to play, the player falls back to the second in the list and so on, until it finds one that can be played.
