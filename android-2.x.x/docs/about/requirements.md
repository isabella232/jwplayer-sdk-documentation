!!!important
The JW Player SDK for Android v2 is available only to customers with an Enterprise license. JW Player plans to deprecate support for this version of the SDK for Android soon. To ensure that your viewers benefit from ongoing SDK improvements, upgrade to [JW Player SDK for Android v3](https://developer.jwplayer.com/sdk/android/docs/developer-guide/index.html). Please contact your JW Player representative if you have additional questions.
!!!

JW Players’s standard audio and video components rely on Android’s MediaCodec API, which was released in Android 4.1 (API level 16). Hence the JW Player SDK does not work on earlier versions of Android. In addition, for VP9 playback the hardware must support VP9 decoding.
