The JW Player SDK for Android v2 is available only to customers with an Enterprise license. JW Player plans to deprecate support for this version of the SDK for Android soon. To ensure that your viewers benefit from ongoing SDK improvements, upgrade to [JW Player SDK for Android v3](https://developer.jwplayer.com/sdk/android/docs/developer-guide/index.html). Please contact your JW Player representative if you have additional questions.
!!!

Your 1.x license key will not work with the JW Player SDK for Android 2.0 and above. You can get your new mobile-only license key from the JW Player Dashboard.
