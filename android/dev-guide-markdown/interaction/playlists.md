# Creating a Playlist

Multiple pieces of content can be sent into the player as a playlist as shown below.

```java
// Create a list to contain the PlaylistItems
List<PlaylistItem> playlist = new ArrayList<>();

// Add a PlaylistItem pointing to the first piece of content
playlist.add(new PlaylistItem("http://content/tv-show-pilot-adaptive.m3u8"));

// Add another PlaylistItem pointing to the second piece of content
// This time using the Builder
playlist.add(new PlaylistItem.Builder()
    .file("http://content/tv-show-ep2.mp4")
    .image("http://content/tv-show-poster-image.jpg")
    .description("A good TV show")
    .build());

// Add a final piece of content
playlist.add(new PlaylistItem("http://content/tv-show-ep3.mp4"));

// Load the playlist into the player
