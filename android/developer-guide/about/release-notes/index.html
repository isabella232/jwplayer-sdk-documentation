<p>We are excited to announce JW Player SDK 3.0 for Android. This release updates the SDK to <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/jw8/">JW8</a> and leverages its new UI &amp; UX, optimization, and advertising enhancements to engage your audiences intelligently and monetize your content. In the coming months we will deploy more JW8 features into the JW Player SDKs for iOS &amp; Android, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Please refer to this important <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/sdk/android/docs/developer-guide/migration/v3/">3.x migration guide for Android</a> to update your current application from version 2.x to 3.x. This guide includes important information about API changes, new features &amp; callbacks, and will help your team with the transition process.</p>
<p>You may use Maven to update to SDK 3.x, or you can download the SDK 3 packages and new 3.x license keys from the Publish -&gt; Tools section of your JW Player Dashboard. Please note that version 3 of the SDKs are available to our Enterprise edition customers, and require new license keys because 2.x license keys will not work.</p>

<p>Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the JW Player SDK for Android to make it easier for developers to add world-class media playback to any Android app. The <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/sdk/android/docs/developer-guide/migration/v2/" title="JW SDK for Android Migration Guide">migration guide</a> with API changes and code examples, makes upgrading from 1.x to 2.0 a breeze.</p>
<p>2.0 also marks a significant step toward our goal of “One JW Player”. The developer-facing APIs in the SDK are native to the target platform, but they are wrappers around our flagship JW Player 7 JavaScript/HTML5 library (jwplayer.js). The core functionality of the SDK (player customization, captions, analytics, etc.) is powered by JavaScript, but all the developer-facing APIs in the SDK are native Java classes. As a result, we still achieve very high performance by doing the actual video decoding and playback in native code.</p>
<p>One of the many benefits of this “One JW Player” architectural change is our ability to leverage JW Player 7 features such as CSS skinning and a DPI-responsive player UI optimized for mobile.</p>
<p>For more information about our JW Player SDK for Android 2.0 release, please read our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/blog/" title="JW Blog">blog post</a>. Thanks!</p>
